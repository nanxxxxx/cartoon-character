        <h2>About Bing bong</h2>
        <p>Bing bong is awesome!
            Bing Bong was Riley's adorable imaginary friend created during her early childhood.
            However, as Riley grew older, she stopped playing with him,
            leaving Bing Bong out of a job and a bit lonely.</p>
        <p>Drifting around Long Term Memory unbeknownst to the other mental denizens,
            he collected happy memories he liked into a bottomless bag.
            He greatly missed the times he shared with Riley and was desperate
            to not be forgotten.</p>
