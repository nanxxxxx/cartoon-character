        <h2>About Judy</h2>
        <p>Judy is awesome! 
            Judy Hopps is the first bunny ever to join Zootopia's police department. 
            Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the chance to crack a case, 
            even if it means teaming up with a con artist fox.</p>
        <p>Judy is fiercely optimistic and independent. 
            Since childhood, she had harbored a dream to become a police officer, 
            to make the world a better place. She cares for the well-being of others, 
            and is always willing to extend a helping hand.</p>
        <p>Due to being a rabbit, a species not known for being police officers, 
            Judy faced continuous doubt from those around her, 
            from her parents to local bullies. 
            Nevertheless, she used this doubt as a means to increase her determination.</p>
